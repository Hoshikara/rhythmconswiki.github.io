# Lamp Holders

Each brand of button features its own style of lamp holder. They are **not** interchangeable between brands, so keep this in mind when changing buttons. Both styles of Sanwa lamp holders will work in any Sanwa button.

{: .warning}
Not all "generic chinese button" lamp holders have the same tolerances. Although they make work in other buttons than the ones purchased at the same time, it should not be assumed they will.
