## Buttons

### How to I stop my buttons from sticking?

Remove the button from the housing and clean both. You can try cleaning them with a dry cloth, or use warm water and a mild soap (such as dish soap).

If the problem persists, inspect the edges of your button (the clear portion) for any sharp edges and use sandpaper (320 grit or higher) to remove them.
