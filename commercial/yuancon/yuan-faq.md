## About

This page lists frequently asked questions related to YuanCon controllers, intended to consolidate the information spread across the YuanCon Discord server. You should also check the [Maintenance FAQ](../../getting-started/maintenance-faq.md) page.

[This page](https://oniichan.wtf/help/) may also contain helpful information, although much of the information is outdated for newer controllers.

Also note that despite releasing after the SDVX 12, the SDVX Lite (Gen 1 and 2) is considered to come before the SDVX 12 because it uses an older controller PCB.
