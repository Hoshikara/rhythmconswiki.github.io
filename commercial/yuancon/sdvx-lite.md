The Yuancon SDVX Lite was first sold internationally in November 2021. It is Yuan's budget option, featuring an all-white case and acrylic panel, and two straight RGB strips between the start button and knobs.

## Troubleshooting

This section lists troubleshooting and known issues with the controller.

### I can't play EAC

To play EAC, make sure you're on the latest version of the firmware. See [YuanCon Firmware]({$ link commercial/yuancon/firmware.md $}).

Although the instructions say press both FX buttons, you may need to press both side buttons instead to enter the firmware update mode.
